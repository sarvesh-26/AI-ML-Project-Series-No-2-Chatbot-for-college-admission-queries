# AI-ML-Project-Series-No-2-Chatbot-for-college-admission-queries
Student query chatbot for college admissions: A personalized assistant designed to address inquiries regarding college admission
procedures, requirements, and deadlines, offering real-time guidance and support to prospective students.


    Libraries Import: The code imports necessary libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), NumPy, and scikit-learn for 
    natural language processing, array management, and data splitting, respectively.

    Data Preprocessing: There's a function called data_preprocessing that handles the preprocessing of data. It reads data 
    from a JSON file containing intents related to college admissions. This function tokenizes the patterns in the intents,
    stems the words, and creates a bag-of-words representation for each pattern.

    Model Training: The training data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. Then, an initialization 
    
    function init_model is called to create and train a model using TensorFlow (not shown in the provided code).

    Bag of Words Representation: A function named bag_of_words converts input sentences into a bag-of-words representation, which is essential for feeding data into the model during inference.

    Chat Interface: Finally, the chat function is called to initiate the chat interface. This interface utilizes the trained model and the bag-of-words representation to allow users to interact with the chatbot and receive responses regarding college admissions.

Overall, the code demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot system tailored for handling queries related to college admissions, covering aspects such as data preprocessing, model training, and interaction with users through a chat interface.
